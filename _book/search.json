    "text": "Preface\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. EDA is primarily for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing tasks..\nThe EDA approach can be broken down into the following steps:\nData Cleaning: This step includes handling missing data, removing outliers, and other data cleansing processes.\nUnivariate Analysis: Here, each field in the dataset is analyzed independently to better understand its distribution, outliers, and unique values. This could involve statistical plots for measuring central tendency like mean, median, mode, frequency distribution, quartiles, etc.\nBivariate Analysis: This step involves the analysis of two variables to determine the empirical relationship between them. It includes techniques such as scatter plots for continuous variables or crosstabs for categorical data.\nMultivariate Analysis: This is an advanced step, involving analysis with more than two variables. It helps to understand the interactions between different fields in the dataset.\nData Visualization: This is the creation of plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc., to identify patterns, relationships, or outliers within the dataset. This can be done using visualization tools or libraries.\nInsight Generation: After visualizations and some statistical tests, analysts will generate insights that could lead to further questions, hypotheses, and model building.\nThe EDA process is an important precursor to more complex analyses because it allows for the researcher to confirm or invalidate some initial hypotheses and to formulate a more precise question or hypothesis that can lead to further statistical analysis and testing."

The “c()” function can be used to create vectors, and indexing can be used to access individual vector elements.\nFactor: A factor is a vector representing categorical data, with each distinct value or category represented as a level. Using indexing, individual levels of a factor can be accessed using the “factor()” function.\nDataframe: Similar to a spreadsheet, a data frame is a two-dimensional table-like structure that can store various types of data in columns. The “data.frame()” function can be used to construct data frames, and individual elements can be accessed using row and column indexing.\nMatrix: A matrix is a two-dimensional array of data with identical rows and columns.

    "section": "4.2 Vectors",
    "text": "4.2 Vectors\n\nA vector is a fundamental data structure in R that can hold a sequence of values of the same data type, such as integers, numeric, character, or logical values.\nA vector can be created using the c() function.\nR supports two forms of vectors: atomic vectors and lists. Atomic vectors are limited to containing elements of a single data type, such as numeric or character. Lists, on the other hand, can contain elements of various data types and structures. [1]\n\n\n4.2.1 Vectors in R\n\nThe following R code creates a numeric vector, a character vector and a logical vector respectively.\n\n\n# Read data into vectors\nnames &lt;- c(\"Ashok\", \"Bullu\", \"Charu\", \"Divya\")\nages &lt;- c(72, 49, 46, 42)\nfemales &lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)\n\n\nThe c() function is employed to combine the four character elements into a single vector.\nCommas separate the elements of the vector within the parentheses.\nIndividual elements of the vector can be accessed via indexing, which utilizes square brackets []. For instance, names[1] returns “Ashok”, while names[3] returns “Charu”.\nWe can also perform operations such as categorizing and filtering on the entire vector. For instance, sort(names) returns a vector of sorted names, whereas names[names!= “Bullu”] returns a vector of names excluding “Bullu.”\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Vector Operations\nVectors can be used to perform the following vector operations:\n\nAccessing Elements: We can use indexing with square brackets to access individual elements of a vector. To access the second element of the “names” vector, for instance, we can use:\n\n\nnames[2]\n\n[1] \"Bullu\"\n\n\nThis returns “Bullu”, the second element of the “names” vector.\n\nConcatenation: The “c()” function can be used to combine multiple vectors into a single vector. For instance, to combine the “names” and “ages” vectors into the “people” vector, we can use:\n\n\npersons &lt;- c(names, ages)\npersons\n\n[1] \"Ashok\" \"Bullu\" \"Charu\" \"Divya\" \"72\"    \"49\"    \"46\"    \"42\"   \n\n\nThis generates an eight-element vector containing the names and ages of the four people.\n\nSubsetting: We can use indexing with a logical condition to construct a new vector that contains a subset of elements from an existing vector. For instance, to construct a new vector named “female_names” containing only the females’ names, we can use:\n\n\nfemale_names &lt;- names[females == TRUE]\nfemale_names\n\n[1] \"Bullu\" \"Charu\" \"Divya\"\n\n\nThis generates a new vector comprising three elements containing the names of the three females (“Bullu”, “Charu”, and “Divya”).\n\nArithmetic Operations: We can perform element-wise arithmetic operations on vectors. To calculate the sum of the “ages” vector, for instance, we can use:\n\n\nsum(ages)\n\n[1] 209\n\n\nThis returns 209, the sum of the four ages.\n\nLogical Operations: We can perform logical operations on vectors, which are also executed element-by-element. To create a new vector titled “middle_age” that indicates whether each individual is 45 to 55 years old, for instance, we can use:\n\n\nmiddle_age &lt;- (ages &gt;= 45) & (ages &lt;= 55)\nmiddle_age\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThis generates a new vector with four elements containing logical values indicating whether each person is between 45 and 55 years of age.\nTo test whether any of the elements in the “ages” vector are greater than 50, we can use:\n\nany(ages &gt; 50)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nUnique Values: We can find the unique values in a vector using the “unique()” function. For example, to find the unique values in the “ages” vector, we can use:\n\n\nunique(ages)\n\n[1] 72 49 46 42\n\n\n\nSorting: We can sort a vector in ascending or descending order using the “sort()” function. For example, to sort the “ages” vector in descending order, we can use:\n\n\nsort(ages, decreasing = TRUE)\n\n[1] 72 49 46 42\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Statistical Operations on Vectors\n\nLength: The length represents the count of the number of elements in a vector.\n\n\nlength(ages)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nMaximum and Minimum: The maximum and minimum values are the vector’s greatest and smallest values, respectively.\nRange: The range is a measure of the spread that represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a vector.\n\n\nmin(ages)\n\n[1] 42\n\nmax(ages)\n\n[1] 72\n\nrange(ages)\n\n[1] 42 72\n\n\n\nMean: The mean is a central tendency measure that represents the average value of a vector’s elements.\nStandard Deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of dispersion that reflects the amount of variation in a vector’s elements.\nVariance: The variance is another measure of the spread. It is square of the Standard Deviation.\n\n\nmean(ages)\n\n[1] 52.25\n\nsd(ages)\n\n[1] 13.47529\n\nvar(ages)\n\n[1] 181.5833\n\n\n\nMedian: The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a sorted vector.\n\n\nmedian(ages)\n\n[1] 47.5\n\n\n\nQuantiles: The quantiles are a set of cut-off points that divide a sorted vector into equal-sized groups.\n\n\nquantile(ages)\n\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n42.00 45.00 47.50 54.75 72.00 \n\n\nThis will return a set of five values, representing the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the four ages.\nThus, we note that the R programming language provides a wide range of statistical operations that can be performed on vectors for data analysis and modeling. Vectors are clearly a potent and versatile data structure that can be utilized in a variety of ways.\n\n\n4.2.4 Strings\nHere are some common string operations that can be conducted using the provided vector examples.\n\nSubstring: The substr() function can be used to extract a substring from a character vector. To extract the first three characters of each name in the “names” vector, for instance, we can use:\n\n\nsubstr(names, 1, 3)\n\n[1] \"Ash\" \"Bul\" \"Cha\" \"Div\"\n\n\nThis returns a new character vector containing the initial three letters of each name (“Ash”, “Bul”, “Cha”, and “Div”).\n\nConcatenation: Using the paste() function, we can concatenate two or more character vectors into a singular vector. To create a new vector containing the names and ages of the individuals, for instance, we can use:\n\n\npersons &lt;- paste(names, ages)\npersons\n\n[1] \"Ashok 72\" \"Bullu 49\" \"Charu 46\" \"Divya 42\"\n\n\nThis will generate a new eight-element character vector containing the name and age of each individual, separated by a space.\n\nCase Conversion: The toupper() and tolower() functions can be used to convert the case of characters within a character vector. To convert the “names” vector to uppercase letters, for instance, we can use:\n\n\ntoupper(names)\n\n[1] \"ASHOK\" \"BULLU\" \"CHARU\" \"DIVYA\"\n\n\nThis will generate a new character vector with all of the names converted to uppercase.\n\nPattern Matching: Using the grep() and grepl() functions, we can search for a pattern within the elements of a character vector. To find the names in the “names” vector that contain the letter “a”, for instance, we can use:\n\n\ngrep(\"a\", names)\n\n[1] 3 4\n\n\nThis returns a vector containing the indexes of the “names” vector elements that contain the letter “a.”\n\nRegular Expressions: We can use regular expressions with the grep() and grepl() functions to search for patterns in the elements of a character vector. To find the names in the “names” vector that begin with the letter “C”, for instance, we can use:\n\n\ngrep(\"^C\", names)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nThis returns a vector containing the indexes of the elements in “names” that begin with the letter “C.” [1]"

    "text": "5.3 Reading different file formats into a dataframe\n\nWe examine how to read data into a dataframe in R when the original data is stored in prominent file formats such as CSV, Excel, and Google Sheets.\nBefore learning how to accomplish this, it is necessary to comprehend how to configure the Working Directory in R.\n\n\n5.3.1 Working Directory\n\nThe working directory is the location where R searches for and saves files by default.\nBy default, when we execute a script or import data into R, R will search the working directory for files.\nUsing R’s getwd() function, we can examine our current working directory:\n\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/cloud/project\"\n\n\n\nWe are running R in the Cloud and hence we are seeing that the working directory is specified as /cloud/project/DataAnalyticsBook101. If we are doing R programming on a local computer, and if our working directory is the Desktop, then we may see a different response such as C:/Users/YourUserName/Desktop.\nUsing R’s setwd() function, we can change our current working directory. For example, the following code will set our working directory to the Desktop:\n\n\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/YourUserName/Desktop\")\n\n\nWe should choose an easily-remembered and accessible working directory to store our R scripts and data files. Additionally, we should avoid using spaces, special characters, and non-ASCII characters in file paths, as these can cause file handling issues in R. [2]\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Reading a CSV file into a dataframe\n\nCSV is the abbreviation for “Comma-Separated Values.” A CSV file is a plain text file that stores structured tabular data.\nEach entry in a CSV file represents a record, whereas each column represents a field. The elements in each record are separated by commas (hence the name Comma-Separated Values), semicolons, or tabs.\nBefore proceeding ahead, it is imperative that the file that we wish to read is located in the Working Directory.\nSuppose we wish to import a CSV file named mtcars.csv, located in the Working Directory. We can use the read.csv() function, illustrated as follows.\n\n\ndf_csv &lt;- read.csv(\"mtcars.csv\")\n\n\nIn this example, the read.csv() function reads the mtcars.csv file into a data frame named df_csv.\nIf the file is not in the current working directory, the complete file path must be specified in the read.csv() function argument; otherwise, an error will occur.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Reading an Excel (xlsx) file into a dataframe\n\nSuppose we wish to import a Microsoft Excel file named mtcars.xlsx, located in the Working Directory.\nWe can use the read_excel function in the R package readxl, illustrated as follows.\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\ndf_xlsx &lt;- read_excel(\"mtcars.xlsx\")\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Reading a Google Sheet into a dataframe\n\nGoogle Sheets is a ubiquitous cloud-based spreadsheet application developed by Google. It is a web-based application that enables collaborative online creation and modification of spreadsheets.\nWe can import data from a Google Sheet into a R dataframe, as follows.\n\n\nConsider a Google Sheet whose preferences have been set such that anyone can view it using its URL. If this is not done, then some authentication would become necessary.\nEvery Google Sheet is characterized by a unique Sheet ID, embedded within the URL. For example, consider a Google Sheet containing some financial data concerning S&P500 index shares.\nSuppose the Sheet ID is: 1nm688a3GsPM5cadJIwu6zj336WBaduglY9TSTUaM9jk\nWe can use the function gsheet2tbl in package gsheet to read the Google Sheet into a dataframe, as demonstrated in the following code.\n\n\n# Read recent S&P500 data that is posted in a Google Sheet.\nlibrary(gsheet)\n\nprefix &lt;- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/\"\nsheetID &lt;- \"1nm688a3GsPM5cadJIwu6zj336WBaduglY9TSTUaM9jk\"\nsuffix &lt;- \"/edit#gid=0\"\n\n# Form the URL to connect to\nurl &lt;- paste(prefix, sheetID, suffix) \n\n# Read the Google Sheet located at the URL into a dataframe called gf\ngf &lt;- gsheet2tbl(url)\n\nNo encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.\n\n\n\nThe first line imports the gsheet package required to access Google Sheets into R.\nThe following three lines define URL variables for Google Sheets. The prefix variable contains the base URL for accessing Google Sheets, the sheetID variable contains the ID of the desired Google Sheet, and the suffix variable contains the URL’s suffix.\nThe paste() function is used to combine the prefix, sheetID, and suffix variables into a complete URL for accessing the Google Sheet.\nThe gsheet2tbl() function from the gsheet package is then used to read the specified Google Sheet into a dataframe called gf.\nOnce the preceding code is executed, the gf dataframe will contain the Google Sheet data, which can then be analyzed further in R.\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Joining or Merging two dataframes\n\nSuppose we have a second S&P 500 data located in a second Google Sheet and suppose that we would like to join or merge the data in this dataframe with the above dataframe gf.\nThe ID of this second sheet is: 1F5KvFATcehrdJuGjYVqppNYC9hEKSww9rXYHCk2g6OA\nWe can read the data present in this Google Sheet using the following code, similar to the one discussed above, using the following code.\n\n\n# Read additional S&P500 data presend in another Google Sheet.\nlibrary(gsheet)\n\nprefix &lt;- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/\"\nsheetID &lt;- \"1F5KvFATcehrdJuGjYVqppNYC9hEKSww9rXYHCk2g6OA\"\nsuffix &lt;- \"/edit#gid=0\"\n\n# Form the URL to connect to\nurl &lt;- paste(prefix, sheetID, suffix) \n\n# Read the Google Sheet located at the URL into a dataframe called tv\ntv &lt;- gsheet2tbl(url)\n\nNo encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8.\n\n\n\nWe now have two dataframes named tv and gf that we wish to merge or join.\nThe two dataframes have a column named Stock in common, which will serve as the key.\nThe following code illusrates how to merge two dataframes:\n\n\n# merging dataframes\nM.df &lt;- merge(tv, gf , id = \"Stock\")\n\n\nWe now have a new dataframe named M.df, which contains the data got from merging the two dataframes tv and gf."

    "section": "5.4 Tibbles",
    "text": "5.4 Tibbles\n\nA tibble is a contemporary and enhanced variant of a R data frame that is part of the tidyverse package collection.\nTibbles are created and manipulated using the dplyr package, which provides a suite of functions optimized for data manipulation.\nThe following characteristics distinguish a tibble from a conventional data frame:\nTibbles must always have unique, non-empty column names. Tibbles do not permit the creation or modification of columns using partial matching of column names. Tibbles improve the output of large datasets by displaying by default only a few rows and columns.\nTibbles have a more consistent behavior for subsetting, with the use of [[ always returning a vector or NULL, and [] always returning a tibble.\nHere is an example of using the tibble() function in dplyr to construct a tibble:\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n# Create a tibble\nmy_tibble &lt;- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35),\n  gender = c(\"F\", \"M\", \"M\")\n)\n\n# Print the tibble\nmy_tibble\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name      age gender\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Alice      25 F     \n2 Bob        30 M     \n3 Charlie    35 M     \n\n\n\nThis will generate a tibble consisting of three columns (name, age, and gender) and three rows of data. Note that the column names are preserved and the tibble is printed in a compact and legible manner.\n\n\n5.4.1 Converting a dataframe into a tibble\n\n# Create a data frame\nmy_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"),\n  age = c(25, 30, 35),\n  gender = c(\"F\", \"M\", \"M\")\n)\n\n# Convert the data frame to a tibble\nmy_tibble &lt;- as_tibble(my_df)\n\n# Print the tibble\nmy_tibble\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name      age gender\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Alice      25 F     \n2 Bob        30 M     \n3 Charlie    35 M     \n\n\n\nThis assigns the tibble representation of the data frame my_df to the variable my_tibble.\nNote that the resulting tibble has the same column names and data as the original data frame, but has the additional characteristics and behaviors of a tibble.\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Converting a tibble into a dataframe\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Convert the tibble to a data frame\nmy_df &lt;- as.data.frame(my_tibble)\n\n# Print the data frame\nmy_df\n\n     name age gender\n1   Alice  25      F\n2     Bob  30      M\n3 Charlie  35      M\n\n\n\nA tibble offers several advantages over a data frame in R:\n\n\nLarge datasets can be printed with greater clarity and precision using Tibbles. By default, they only print the first few rows and columns, making it simpler to read and comprehend the data structure.\nBetter subsetting behavior: With [[always returning a vector or NULL and [] always returning a tibble, Tibbles have a more consistent subsetting behavior. This facilitates the subset and manipulation of data without unintended consequences.\nConsistent naming: Tibbles always have column names that are distinct and non-empty. This makes it simpler to refer to specific columns and prevents errors caused by duplicate or unnamed column names.\nMore informative errors: Tibbles provides more informative error messages that make it simpler to diagnose and resolve data-related problems.\nFewer surprises: Tibbles have more stringent constraints than data frames, resulting in fewer surprises and unexpected behavior when manipulating data."
